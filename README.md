## Set up

1. Install the required dependencies using Composer:
   ```
   composer install
   ```
2. Run the command:
   ```
   composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
   ```

## Real-Time Collaboration

This application supports real-time collaboration on shared notes. When a note is shared with edit permissions, multiple users can work on it simultaneously.

### Setup

To enable real-time collaboration:

1. Install the required dependencies using Composer:

   ```
   composer install
   ```

2. Start the WebSocket server:

   ```
   php ws-server.php
   ```

   Or on Windows, you can use the provided batch file:

   ```
   start-collaboration-server.bat
   ```

3. The WebSocket server will run on port 8080 by default.

### How It Works

- Users with edit permissions on a shared note can see each other's changes in real-time
- Cursor positions are tracked and displayed to show where each collaborator is working
- Real-time notifications inform users when someone joins or leaves the note
- All changes are automatically saved to the server

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the collaboration feature:

1. **Server not starting**: Make sure you've installed dependencies properly:

   ```
   composer install
   ```

   Then check the console output when starting the server. You should see:

   ```
   WebSocket server started on port 8080
   Collaboration server started.
   ```

2. **Connection errors in browser**:

   - Open your browser's developer console (F12) to see error messages
   - Check if the WebSocket server is running
   - Ensure port 8080 is not blocked by any firewall
   - Try using `localhost` instead of an IP address or hostname

3. **Permission issues**:

   - Make sure the user has EDITOR permission for the note
   - Check if the note owner has shared the note correctly

4. **Other WebSocket issues**:
   - If running behind a proxy, ensure WebSocket connections are supported and configured
   - Some anti-virus or security software might block WebSocket connections
   - Try using a different browser to isolate the issue
