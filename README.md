## Important things to note

1. SQL file is in sql folder
2. If you use bcdn extension to generate html template, replace jquery script tag. jquery slim doesn't have ajax method.
3. If you change html, js code but it doesn't change on screen, clear your browser cache.
4. You need a environment variable called "Environment" with value "Testing" or else skeletondb will use production connection string.
